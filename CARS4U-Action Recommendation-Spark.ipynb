You do this, by determining the input parameters to the bias checker function calls based on your sample data set.\n\nYou add the input parameters to the bias checker function into a helper map function. You can add the following parameters:\n\n - `class_label`: the name of the column in the data frame which you have designated as the classified column. This is the column whose value will be predicted by the machine learning model.\n\n This parameter is **mandatory**.\n\n Examples are a column called `Action`.\n - `protected_attributes`: an array of one or more column names which are likely to show bias towards the class-label.\n\n This parameter is **mandatory**.\n\n Examples are `Gender`, `Age`.\n - `favourable_class`: an array of one or more values of the `class_label` column which depicts a favorable outcome for the end user.\n\n This parameter is **optional**. If not specified, a library finds all of the distinct values of the `class_label` column and runs the bias detection algorithm multiple times on those extracted values. During each run it assumes one value from the set of distinct values as the favorable outcome and the rest as unfavorable. The library reports the top three biases found across all these runs.\n\n Examples of favorable outcomes for a class-label called `Action` is `On-demand pickup location`, `Voucher`, `Free Upgrade`, `Premium features`, and `NA` is an unfavorable outcome.\n - `majority`: map of expressions describing the majority group for each protected attribute.\n\n This parameter is **optional**.\n\n An example is taking `Age` as the protected attribute and specifying the majority group as `{'majority' : 'Age' : '[26,60]' } or {'majority' : 'Age' : '<60'}`.\n - `minority`: map of expressions describing the minority group for each protected attribute.\n\n This parameter is **optional**.\n\n An example is taking `Age` as the protected attribute and specifying the minority group as  `{'minority' : 'Age' : '[60,70]' } or {'minority' : 'Age' : '>=60' }`.\n - `threshold`: the decisive factor in determining the presence of bias. This value empowers organizations to have their own personalized criteria for bias.\n\n This parameter is **optional**. If not specified, the taken default is 0.8. If a bias score is below 0.8, then the presence of bias is confirmed.\n    ",
